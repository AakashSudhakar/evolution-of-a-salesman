## Project Proposal

---

This project aims to apply genetic algorithms in order to approximate a confident solution to the Traveling Salesman problem at a variable scale.

---

The general hierarchy towards constructing a _genetic algorithm_ is as follows:

1. Create the population.
2. Determine fitness.
3. Select the mating pool.
4. Breed.
5. Mutate.
6. Repeat.

### PROPOSED ACTION PLAN:

- [x] ~~Created main file architecture.~~
- [x] ~~Created custom class for City logic.~~
- [x] ~~Populated City class with relevant distance calculation methods.~~
- [x] ~~Wrote test cases for City class functionality.~~
- [x] ~~Created custom class for Fitness calculation.~~
- [x] ~~Populated Fitness class with relevant distance and fitness conversion methods.~~
- [ ] Write test cases for Fitness class functionality.
- [ ] Create initial population of city data to serve as our _first generation_.
