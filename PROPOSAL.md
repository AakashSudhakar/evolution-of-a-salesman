## Project Proposal

---

This project aims to apply genetic algorithms in order to approximate a confident solution to the Traveling Salesman problem at a variable scale.

---

The general hierarchy towards constructing a _genetic algorithm_ is as follows:

1. Create the population.
2. Determine fitness.
3. Select the mating pool.
4. Breed.
5. Mutate.
6. Repeat.
