# Evolution of a Salesman

### Applying a Genetic (Evolutionary) Algorithm to Approximate a Solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem

---

The **Traveling Salesman** problem is a classic abstract mathematical problem that posits the following question:

> _"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?"_

This problem lies at the heart of combinatorial algorithmic mathematics and can be approached using **genetic algorithms** - a subset of evolutionary heuristic algorithms designed to solve NP-Hard problems.

This project was created with reference to **Eric Stoltz**'s tutorial on _Towards Data Science_ regarding applying genetic algorithms to the Traveling Salesman problem.
